Today, I started with flutter and its my day one on day one, I learned about how to dowload and setup andriod studio and flutter packages,
I got some errors like java package is not updated but after copy pasting jbr files in jre files I am able to solve the error and at the end I have succefully runed the 
existing code given by flutter to add number count.
I have added screenshot of output in image file!
